    <score_reasons> 
        BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese charcaters, the cells are just blank.
        BAD: the beginner sentence is nexessary,shoul start showing the vocabulary table.
        BAD: in the clues we should not provide the cpolite form of verbs , because the student needs to figure that out.
        BAD: The sentence structure says too much we we really want something that is  conceptual like this : [Location] [Subject] [Verb] , [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Let's work through the transcription together.
        Vocabulary Table:
        
        | Japanese | Romaji 	| English                   |
        |          | kuma	    | bear                      |
        |          | tobira     | door                      |
        |          | ---	    | gomi	garbage             |
        |          | suteru     | to throw away             |
        |          | deru	    | to go out, leave          |
        |          | shiranai   | don't know, didn't notice |
        |          | haitteiru  | is inside                 |
        However, I think a better fit for "leave the garbage out" might be:
        |Japanese	|Romaji	|English |
        |           |soto	|outside |
        And for "did you" in this context, let's consider:
        |Japanese	|Romaji	|English|
        |           |shita	|did    |
        Possible Sentence Structure:
        The sentence could be broken down into two parts:
        Statement about bears being at the door
        Question about leaving the garbage out
        For the first part, the structure might be: (noun) wa (location) ni imasu.
        For the second part, the structure might be: (object) o (location) ni dashite okimashita ka?
        Your turn! What do you think the transcription could be?
        If you need more clues or want to check your work, feel free to ask. When you're ready, I can give you more hints or guidance, but I won't give away the final answer just yet!

    <score_reasons> 
        GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start and show vocabulary immediately
        GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence structure
        GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense or conjugations.
        GOOD: doesn't give particles

    <assistant: output>
        let me provide you with the vocabulary and structure for this compound sentence.
        Cheatsheet: 
        |Word   | Japanese  |Type |
        |bear   | 熊(くよ)   |Noun |
        |door   | ドア      |Noun |
        |garbage| ゴミ      |Noun |
        |to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
        |to leave | 出す(だす) | Transitive Godan Verb |

        Sentence structure:
        [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
         Considerations:
        - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
        - The first part is stating a location where something exists
        - The second part is asking about a past action

        Possible next steps:
        - attempt an answer
        - ask clues about location marking
        - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
        - ask clues about question formation
        - ask clues about verb conjugation
